Since I saw _Neal Agarwal_'s absurd trolley problems, I decided to make my own version. We were then given the task of developing a leadership guide application. Despite using a quiz template, I opted to create my own game app and take use of the opportunity to experiment with React hooks, MemoryRouter, local storage, and CSS animations.  

Enjoy! And don't forget to give it a star if you like it.  
**P.S: Any contribution is welcome.**
