### Since I saw _Neal Agarwal_'s absurd trolley problems website, I decided to make my own version!

### We were then given the task of developing a leadership guide application. Despite using a quiz template, I opted to create my own game app and take use of the opportunity to experiment with React hooks ⚛️, MemoryRouter 🧠, local storage 💾, and CSS animations 🎨.

### Enjoy! And don't forget to give it a star if you like it ⭐
**P.S: Any contribution is welcome.**
